# INTELLIGENT-PROPERTY-ANALYSER

Intelligent Property Analyser is a smart, machine learning-driven web application that helps users estimate the market value of residential properties â€” instantly and accurately.

Powered by Python and trained on real-world housing data, this project blends the power of machine learning, Flask-based APIs, and a responsive web interface to deliver a seamless property valuation experience. Whether you're a homeowner, investor, or a curious learner, this tool gives you insights into housing prices based on factors like location, area, number of rooms, and more.

ðŸ§  Behind the scenes, a trained Random Forest Regression model processes the input and returns accurate predictions. On the frontend, users are greeted with a clean and interactive UI built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. All predictions are logged and managed with a secure MySQL database, making the system efficient, trackable, and scalable.

This project was developed as part of the TCS iON Internship Program and demonstrates the practical application of AI in the real estate domain.

âœ¨ Key Highlights:
- End-to-end ML system with web deployment
- Real-time property price predictions
- Clean, responsive user interface
- Fully integrated with MySQL for data storage
- Great for academic portfolios and demos
